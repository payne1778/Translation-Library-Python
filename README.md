# Translation-Library-Python

### TL-PYTHON OPERATIONAL STATUS: *Borked*

> [!NOTE]
> I am currently working on a massive overhaul with the TL Python implementation.
> Conversion to an offical Python package, reconstruction the CLI, and implementation with feature-rich libraries are underway.
> For right now, expect the documentation to be out-of-date and code to be non-functional.

### Overhaul Progress:

- Converted source code into a local package 
- Added a `utils` for handy utilities for pathing and interacting with TOML files
- Added test cases for functions within the pathing, TOML, and language utiliies 
- Added Pydantic validation for function args
- Add a logging system
- Add docstring documentation to functions


### Future Project Goals:
- Make source code a public package available on PIP
- Use a library to handle sysargs in the CLI
- Add more validation and error handling with functions
- Add more test cases for functions
- Add a nice way to format placeholder args this time
- Start using semantic versioning after soon (might be after 1.0.0 😭)
